# Tailwind

Why use tailwind? I have found the utility classes are excellent.

## Encapsulating patterns

* utilities: e.g. `sq-8` which maps `h-8 w-8`
* Use a prefix like `ui-` before your custom 

There are 3 main kinds utilities to generate:

* shortcuts for common elements like:
    * buttons
    * inputs
* page structure that consolidates structural DOM element styling with items like:
    * page size
    * flexbox
* color and text size conventions
